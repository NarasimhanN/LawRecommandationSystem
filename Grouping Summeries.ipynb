    "    Preprocessing your data: Sometimes, preprocessing your data can improve clustering results. For example, you can try removing stop words, stemming or lemmatizing the text, or using different text normalization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changing the feature representation: The choice of features can have a significant impact on clustering results. You can try using different feature representations, such as word embeddings, topic models, or other types of text features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tuning other hyperparameters: In addition to eps and min_samples, DBSCAN has other hyperparameters that can be tuned, such as the distance metric used to measure similarity between data points. You can try experimenting with different distance metrics or other hyperparameters to see if it improves your clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Trying a different clustering algorithm: If none of the above steps improve your clustering results, it may be worth trying a different clustering algorithm altogether. There are many clustering algorithms available, such as K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, Spectral Clustering, and others, each with their own strengths and weaknesses."
